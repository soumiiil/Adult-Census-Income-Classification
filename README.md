## 🔬 Project Details

### 1. 💰 [Adult Census Income Classification](./Adult%20Census%20Income%20Classification/)

Predicts whether an individual's annual income exceeds **$50K** based on census data. Compares **5 classifiers** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM) on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.

**Dataset:** Adult Census Income Dataset (Kaggle) — ~32,561 records, 14 features  
**Pipeline:** Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering (One-Hot, StandardScaler) → Model Training → Evaluation

---

### 2. 🧠 [Cancer Classification — Brain Tumor MRI](./Cancer%20Classification/)

Classifies brain MRI images into **4 categories** (Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary) using a custom **3-block CNN** with BatchNorm, Dropout, and data augmentation. Targets **90%+ accuracy**.

**Dataset:** Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle) — 5,600 training + 1,600 test images  
**Architecture:** 3 × Conv blocks (32→64→128) + GlobalAveragePooling + EarlyStopping

---

### 3. 🚗 [Car Price Prediction](./car%20price%20prediction/)

Predicts the selling price of used cars using a **Random Forest Regressor**, deployed as a **Flask web app** on Render.

🌍 **Live Demo:** [https://car-price-prediction-app-00au.onrender.com](https://car-price-prediction-app-00au.onrender.com)

**Dataset:** Vehicle Dataset from CarDekho (Kaggle) — ~301 records  
**Features:** Present Price, Kms Driven, Fuel Type, Transmission, Car Age, etc.  
**Deployment:** Flask + Pickle → Render

---

### 4. 🖼️ [CIFAR-10 Image Classification](./CIFAR%2010/)

Classifies **32×32 RGB images** into **10 object categories** (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck) using a custom CNN with data augmentation. Targets **85%+ accuracy**.

**Dataset:** CIFAR-10 — 50,000 training + 10,000 test images (loaded via TensorFlow)  
**Architecture:** 3 × Conv blocks (32→64→128) + Flatten + Dense + ReduceLROnPlateau

---

### 5. 👤 [LFW Face Recognition](./LFW%20face%20recognition/)

Recognizes **faces of 7 public figures** from the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset using a custom CNN. Handles limited training data through augmentation and stratified splitting.

**Dataset:** LFW — 1,288 grayscale images (50×37), 7 classes (loaded via scikit-learn)  
**Architecture:** 3 × Conv blocks (32→64→128) + EarlyStopping (patience=20)

---

### 6. 🎬 [Movie Recommendation System](./Movie-Recommendation-System/)

A content-based movie recommendation engine using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** on movie genres. Served through a clean **Flask web interface**.

**Dataset:** TMDB Movie Dataset  
**Pipeline:** TF-IDF on genres → Cosine Similarity matrix → Top-N recommendations

---

### 7. 🤖 [RAG Chatbot — Amazon Quarterly Report](./Rag_Chatbot/)

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot that answers questions about Amazon's 10-Q quarterly report, grounded in the actual filing text with **citations**.

**Stack:** FastAPI + Sentence-Transformers (MiniLM) + FAISS (vector search) + Gemini AI  
**Flow:** Embed query → FAISS similarity search → Top-k excerpts → Gemini generates grounded answer

---

### 8. 🎮 [CartPole — PPO Reinforcement Learning](./cartpole/)
